Password Generator is a website that gives users the opportunity to create their own password!

When the user clicks on "Generate Password", it will prompt user to enter between 8 to 128 characters and what character types to include in the password.

These character types are if user wants to add lowercase, uppercase, special characters and numbers. User must make one character type selection or else user has to start the whole process over of creating a password.

The final step is the user will be able to see their generated password in the textbox.
